    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>During COVID-19 I was working at Goldman Sachs.  Probably my best memory of that job was a team cooking class over Zoom where we were able to make this recipe together with the master Moosh himself.  My go-to recipe when I want to impress anybody! </p>

        <li>1/2 Cup Soft Goat Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>For the Vegetables</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine together herbs de provence, flakey salt, and 3 tbsp of olive oil together in a small bowl. Divide the mixture into three different containers.</li>
        <li>In each of the three containers, separately add your sliced chinese eggplant, yellow squash, and zucchini. Toss with the oil salt mixture and allow to stand for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once vegetables are cured, very gently press the flesh of the vegetables between your hands to remove some of the mositures and juices. Discard the run off liquid and reserve the vegetables in separate clusters for assembling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add olive oil to a heavy based saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add diced onions, red pepper flakes and a pinch of salt and sauté for 3-4 minutes until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and sauté for 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Add diced red and yellow bell peppers, and herbs de provence and sweat for 5-6 minutes until the peppers are soft.</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste and cook out for 2-3 minutes or until caramelized.</li>
        <li>Add crushed heirloom tomatoes, and reduce the heat slightly to medium low. Allow to simmer for 25-30 minutes or until the sauce resembles a tomato jam.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile in an appropriately sized bowl, whisk together crème fraîche and soft goat cheese. Set aside at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Add torn basil to your tomato sauce, and with salt and freshly cracked pepper.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bringing it Together</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a heavy based oven safe pan or casserole dish, place enough sauce in the bottom of the pan to come up 1/4 of an inch. Add several dollops of the crème fraîche + goat cheese mixture throughout the tomato sauce and using a spoon, lightly mix it with the tomato sauce to slightly incorperature.</li>
        <li>Place vegetables in the pan or dish by interlocking the disks of vegetables together in an even order of a single piece of eggplant, followed by zucchini, then yellow squash and lastly tomato. Repeat this sequence, starting from the outside of the pan and working inwards until you have a beautiful spiral of shingled vegetables.</li>
        <li>Mix together 1 tbsp of olive oil, picked thyme, savory, and finely chopped parsley, and drizzle it overtop of the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Cover the ratatouille with a piece of parchment paper or some form of cartouche and place into a preheated oven at 375°F for one hour.</li>
        <li>Remove the ratatouille from the oven and allow to cool for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the parchment or cartouche from overtop of the ratatouille. Garnish with fresh goat’s cheese, herbs and or olive oil. Serve immediately with fresh bread.</li>
    </ol>
