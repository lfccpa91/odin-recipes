    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This warm hearty dish served with egg noodles reminds me of my grandmother's German heritage, as well as my adventures studying abroad in Europe my sophomore year of college. #goodtimes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Teaspoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sweet Hungarian paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon caraway seeds</li>
        <li>1 pound beef stewing meat, trimmed and cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, homemade or low-sodium canned</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>2 roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until wilted, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the paprika and caraway seeds and cook 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, toss the beef with the flour to coat well. Add the beef to the onion mixture.  Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup of the broth, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot. Gradualy stir in the remaining broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a slow simmer.  Cover and cook until the beef is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Stir in the lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste.  Serve over wide egg noodles.</li>
